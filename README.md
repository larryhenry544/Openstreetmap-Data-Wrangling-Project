# OpenStreetMap Data Case Study
This project is part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree course for Data Wrangling

In this project, I've used the following.

### Map Area
Irving, TX, United States

- [https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/5748832](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/5748832)

### Software and Application
- Jupyter Notebook
- Spyder
- Python 3
- sqlite3
- Excel
- SQLiteStudio


This repository consists of the following files : 

- __README.md__ : This is the final report of the work done on this project.

- __data.py__ : This file contains the codes for gathering and extracting the data from the OSM file. The data is then cleaned 
as per the programmer's requirements. Also the cleaned data is stored in CSV files.

- __csv-to-db.py__ : Using the code in this file, each of the CSV files is exported as tables to be stored in a database. Using 
these database we perform the sql queries.

- __Get_Sample_OSM.ipynb__ : This file contains the code to get a sample of the large OSM file.

- __sample_IrvingTX-W-LasColinas.osm__ : This smaller file can aid the programmer in understanding the data involved and the basic structure of the code.
The programmer can start working on these smaller samples of OSM files and then proceed to work on the larger OSM file.

- __References.txt__ : Contains a list of Web sites, forums, blog posts, etc referred to in this submission
