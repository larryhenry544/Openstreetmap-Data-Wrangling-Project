# OpenStreetMap Data Case Study

## Udacity Project Overview
This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree course for Data Wrangling. The main point of this project is to learn how to access data and perform 
data cleaning with Python. To start, I downloaded the OSM data first. Then, I accessed the XML data from the downloaded OpenStreet Map file. Next, I audited 
several fields and performed some data cleaning while parsing the OSM into to five CSV files before importing the files to SQL tables. Last, the cleaned 
data will then be imported into a DBMS or MongoDB. In this case, I used a DBMS and ran a few SQL queries on the cleaned data to complete the project.
